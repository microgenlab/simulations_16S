This database, which is still growing, comprises data collected from multiple collaborators. Diagnostic test manufacturers develop sequence-based tests to identify infectious agents and/or to detect resistance or virulence markers; will use this database to advance their development programs and to support the regulatory science review of such tests. This work will facilitate the development of these tests, which are aimed at improving patient outcomes. Continued success of the database and adoption by the community is contingent on populating and curating the database, which in turn will support development of guidance and standards for clinical use of this technology. Discussions held at a relating public workshop on advancing regulatory science for high throughput sequencing devices for microbial identification and detection of antimicrobial resistance markers were essential to establish the safety and effectiveness of these devices.","2017-05-28T05:15:33.052Z","2017-05-28T05:15:33.052Z"

The global spread of colistin resistance poses a healthcare threat. However, the epidemiology of mcr-1-carrying-plasmids in a local healthcare setting is largely unknown. In this study, we aim to characterize plasmids and their transmission in mcr-1 positive isolates identified from a large hospital in the Netherlands.Methods. We retrospectively included all clinical mcr-1-carrying isolates from patients hospitalized in years 2010-2018. In principle, extracted plasmids from mcr-1 positive isolates were sequenced using a combination of short (iSeq) and long (MinION) reads chemistries. The plasmid hybrid assemblies had their incompatibility type (Inc type) and genetic background characterized. A comparison was performed of the detected plasmids with all public available mcr-1-carrying-plasmids. Results. We confirmed the presence of the mcr-1 in 22 isolates, derived from 14 patients. We identified 21 plasmids, which were described with incompatibility type of IncX4, IncI2, IncHI2 and double Inc types; IncHI2/IncN and IncHI2/IncQ. Additionally, the mcr-1 was identified in the chromosome of a prevalent strain of K. pneumoniae (ST147). Genomic analysis of available mcr-1-carrying-plasmids indicated plasmidal transmission in the hospital through patients and species. Conclusion. In a small collection of isolates, we observed multiple plasmidal transmission cases such as intrapatient-interspecific and among patients hospitalized in different years. Mcr-1 plasmids have a diverse genetic background which can corelate with the Inc type. Plasmid enrichment, and genetic background in all available plasmids contributed in defining transmissions. Understanding the transmission of mcr-1-carrying plasmids, the spread of the mcr-1 gene can be observed, studied and hopefully limited in a local tertiary care center and eventually globally. ","2021-08-26T19:45:32.714Z","2021-08-26T19:45:32.714Z"

Although of significant clinical relevance, complete genome sequences of only four clinical Cpn strains have been obtained. All of them were isolated from the respiratory tract and shared more than 99% sequence identity. Here we investigate genetic differences on the whole-genome level that are related to Cpn tissue tropism and pathogenicity. We have sequenced the genomes of 18 clinical isolates from different anatomical sites (e.g. lung, blood, coronary arteries) of diseased patients, and one animal isolate. In total 1,363 SNP loci and 184 InDels have been identified in the genomes of all clinical Cpn isolates. These are distributed throughout the whole chlamydial genome and enriched in highly variable regions. The genomes show clear evidence of recombination in at least one potential region but no phage insertions. The tyrP gene was always encoded as single copy in all vascular isolates. Phylogenetic reconstruction revealed distinct evolutionary lineages containing primarily non-respiratory Cpn isolates. In one of these, clinical isolates from coronary arteries and blood monocytes were closely grouped together. They could be distinguished from all other isolates by characteristic nsSNPs in genes involved in RB to EB transition, inclusion membrane formation, bacterial stress response and metabolism. This study substantially expands the genomic data of Cpn and elucidates its evolutionary history. Cpn genetic differences related to tissue tropism not only indicate a specific role of the pathogen in the development of chronic disease, but also suggest the development of pathogen-oriented diagnostic strategies in the future.","2016-01-17T16:02:17.001Z","2016-01-17T16:02:17.001Z"

The primary cause of CF-related deaths is chronic microbial infection in the lungs of affected patients. In particular, bacterial pathogens from the Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) are a serious health concern for CF patients, because Bcc can establish persistent infections in the lungs and are highly resistant to antibiotics. Complicating the clinical picture is the fact that CF patients infected with the “same” Burkholderia strains, as identified by the lower-resolution genotyping methods, can have drastically different clinical outcomes. In this study, we sequenced over 200 clinical isolates of B. cenocepacia using Illumina paired-end and PacBio long-read sequencing. Our goal is to capture the genomic diversity and changes that are found in clinical B. cenocepacia isolates.","2017-03-20T08:12:54.803Z","2017-03-20T08:12:54.803Z"
